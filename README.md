# earthquake_damage_ml
This project contains the code to predict the damage grade of a building.



## Problem description
We're trying to predict the ordinal variable damage_grade, which represents a level of damage to the building that was hit by the earthquake. There are 3 grades of the damage:

    1 represents low damage
    2 represents a medium amount of damage
    3 represents almost complete destruction
